This is a a simple game of pong that I decided to make to practice what I have learned in Code You especially when it comes to pseudo code, project planning and managment.

The goal of this style of pong called Pung is to score 3 points to win. Each opponent must score 3 points to strike out the other opponent. 

Pung currently features an unbeatable bot that leads its target using some linear algebra with trig the solution to have it beatable is to use a timer that randomly counts down to pause the target lead calculation.

I plan on finishing it today as of writing this readme file. I followed several software development techniques I have learned from the course including pseudo code. So far this project is my most quality of projects.

Pung is made with the Godot engine and written in gd script. I am primarily a Unity developer while planning this game I determined Unity would be overkill and I don't know very much of c++ so SFML or SDL were out of the question. 

That led me to Godot for this project. I hope to finish this project to apply what I have learned to my jet sim or other projects.
